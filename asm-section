          We discussed about it and eventually decided on a new group name,
          rather than each person’s current group name. We arrive at the name
          MKDK. We believe this is the greatest and most equitable name for
          everyone since it is the first letters for each of our names.

              Everyone can call me Minh for short, I have worked as a developer
              before, so I have little experience in researching and coding. I
              used to do programming on the backend side which requires lots of
              knowledge, therefore, I have good problem solving and
              easy-to-learn new things. My hobbies are programming, playing
              games, and spending time with my family. Moreover, I am interested
              in backend development. Anyway, I have not thought about the
              team's name yet. But I may name it Never Give Up because it has
              been an exceptionally long journey since I started to switch my
              major into IT field, I have been through tough time to finally
              decide to study in IT, and never give up is the slogan I used to
              motivate myself.

              I'm currently in Hoi An, my hometown, which is a rather secure
              place to be despite the pandemic. I'd like to increase my IT
              skills since I enjoy working with algorithms and data and applying
              what I've learnt. After graduating from high school in July, I
              discovered RMIT University is the perfect place to learn, grow,
              and make new friends. In my spare time, I enjoy reading novels or
              playing games to keep myself entertained. Between now and then, I
              intend to pursue a career in both cyber security and video game
              production. I only have a basic knowledge of IT, but I believe I
              could pick it up quickly, and I'm constantly trying to broaden my
              knowledge.

              I was born and grew up in Ho Chi Minh city – Vietnam. During my
              study in high school, I took great interest in English and Math.
              One of my favorite things to do in my leisure time is drawing. I
              also enjoy learning new languages and playing video games. On top
              of all that, I am more interested in technology, and especially
              the coding field. I started to develop my interest for the field
              in the mid of high school and having been exposed to how
              technology worked, my passion for it continued to grow. Being an
              introvert and a very shy person, I am unconfident about myself, so
              i wanted to study in an international environment to build up what
              I am still lacking. Hence, I chose to study IT at RMIT University.
              I may not have any IT experience before, but I believe I will gain
              many academic and soft skills during my time here.

              Incipiently, everyone can call me Ben for short and my nationality
              is Vietnamese. Currently I can express my words and communicate in
              English fluently. Additionally, I can comprehend some basic
              sentences of Spanish. I have a huge devotion with coding since I
              was in my secondary school. On top of that, I usually play
              badminton and basketball with my friends in my free time to
              mitigate the stress after a diligent period, as a rule I will have
              dinner with my family or playing online games such as League of
              Legends, Valorant. I have participated in some coding courses,
              especially the C++ and C# course, reading some IT books,
              discovering the Information Technology sector to crave for my
              desire. Hence, I will have to choose the next home port after I
              have graduated high school and RMIT University that is a
              quintessential environment for me to uncover the erudite work of
              the IT area. Hopefully I hope I will go through my university life
              effortlessly, make many good friends, and get myself equipped with
              many useful knowledge of IT that I could serve for my dream job in
              the long run.

            The one and only progress delayed was that we started to do our final assignment later than other groups.
            Right after the assignment 2 deadline was the Christmas break week, we were way too enjoying our breaktime
            so that we forgot to start the final assignment early. In the meantime, the amount of assignments from other
            courses were due at the same time so we got distracted and forgot to start the assignment right away.
            Besides, the transition from assignment 2 to the final assignment was very smooth because we have all the
            idea. If the due of the assignment was extended, we are very confident that we could bring everyone and Mr
            Long the new game mode and features with further development.

        <li id="heading2">Career Plans</li>
        <ul>
          <div class="info">
            We all have decided to finished and graduated with a bachelor degree in IT, and a clear plan for the future,
            as well as any internship. However, we will be going for different minors in our field. Half of our team
            intended to go for mobile and web development while the other half was to go for Artificial Intelligence.
            Also, all the occupation is going into ways across various regions inside the IT industry, which means all
            the work will contribute to different areas in the IT major.
            Among four members of our group, there is Kiet who is directly interested in game development as a vocation.
            Conversely, Minh’s interest is to become a backend developer so he will have the specialty in working with
            the databases, business logic such as the requirements of the customers and especially the system. Khuong’s
            desired job is become an IT support, he will have the strength in doing the server’s maintenance, configure
            computer systems and diagnose the hardware. Finally, Doanh’s ambition is a web developer, she will be very
            suitable for developing our project since our project was developed on a website platform. Nonetheless, all
            the member’s future job is incompatible, they still have the suitable roles in the project.
            As per our project, for Minh’s specialty, he will be able to build the backend of the game portal such as
            the game server to organize the events and rewards the long-time players. In addition, he will create the
            database of the server to store the user’s information and account, and playtimes of the players. Khuong
            will be suitable with the security and maintenance section of the project since he immersed in the IT
            support position. Doanh’s design talent is very astound so she can build up a perfect frontend of the game
            portal, especially the UI/UX of the game. Ultimately, Kiet will be responsible for the game’s logic since he
            wanted to be a games developer and had the experience about the game programming and additionally, Minh will
            help to create the core of the games together.
